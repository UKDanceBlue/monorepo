# DanceBlue Common Library

This is a package of common code used by the DanceBlue app admin portal, and our
other JS/TS projects. It is used to share type and util code across projects to
avoid inconsistencies and duplication. While anyone else is welcome to use this
project (it is MIT after all) I can't imagine why you would want to.

## Versioning

This package does NOT follow semver, the version changes with the significance
of the changes in the release. Assume all changes are breaking.
