<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

DanceBlue is a University of Kentucky student-run organization that fundraises
year-round and culminates in a 24-hour no sitting, no sleeping dance marathon.
The money raised through DanceBlue is donated to the Golden Matrix Fund,
established to support the kids of the DanceBlue Kentucky Children’s Hospital
Hematology/Oncology Clinic both today and well into the future through an
endowment. DanceBlue funds also support the year-long fundraising engine
and operations that underpin the mission, as well as providing funds to
support research at the UK Markey Cancer Center. The Golden Matrix Fund
was created to benefit the DanceBlue KCH Hematology/Oncology Clinic patients
and families. Childhood cancer not only affects the child physically, but it
also creates many emotional and financial difficulties for the entire family.
The goal of the Golden Matrix Fund is to provide care and support for the kids
through giving them and their parent’s comfort.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.


### Getting up and running

1. Run `yarn install` to install project dependencies, this will take some time
2. Install the development build of the app on your phone (contact the app coordinator if you have an iPhone)
3. Run `yarn start` (or ctrl+shift+b in VSCode) to start Expo's testing environment
4. Scan the QR code Expo generates with your phone's camera
5. You should now be able to work on the code and hot reload the app on expo go as you work
6. In VSCode you can also activate the "attach to packager" debug  configuration to interactively debug the app using VSCode's built-in debugger

### Building

See Expo's [guide](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/) on "distributing your app"

### Some notes for contributors

- Naming convention for files is:
  - PascalCase for files that represent a single entity (i.e. a type or component) unless it is a plain function
  - camelCase for files that represent a collection of entities (i.e. an index file, a collection of values, multiple unrelated exports) or a plain function
  - Folders that are intended to be imported directly should match the case of their subject (i.e. PascalCase for a folder with a component)
  - kebab-case for other folders
- ESlint has rules for most other cases, it is *highly* recommended to install the eslint plugin for your editor or keep `eslint --watch` running in the background
